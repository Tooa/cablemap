2012-mm-dd -- 0.3.0
-------------------
* API breaking changes:
  - Removed functions/methods:
    - models.Cable.from_dict
    - models.Cable.to_dict
    - models.Cable.content_header
    - models.Cable.content_body
    - utils.cable_to_json
    - utils.cable_from_json
    - utils.cable_to_yaml
  - models.Cable.recipients and info_recipients
    return models.Recipient objects
  - models.Cable.references returns models.Reference objects
* models.Cable.summary/reader.parse_summary does not convert newlines into 
  one whitespace character anymore
* Added classification category information to ``interfaces.ICable``.
* Added (experimental) predicate module to filter cables by their identifier
* Added (experimental) support to extract the signer(s) of a cable
* Added (experimental) support to resolve the signer(s) real name of a cable
* Added (experimental) support to extract the comment of the ambassador
* (Re-)added cablemap.core.handler
* Added functions to generate `models.Cable` objects from CSV files and
  to generate events from CSV files.
* Improved summary extraction
* Cable references like "09 FOO 12 AND 13" are detected correctly. 
  "09 FOO 12 AND 13" becomes: ['09FOO12', '09FOO13']
* Reimplemented cable_by_id and cable_page_by_id using an API provided by 
  <http://www.cablegatesearch.net/>.
  The new implementations are *much* faster than the old functions.
  Thanks to Raymond Hill for providing the web service.
* Cable reference SECDEF, SECSTATE, and STATE were interpreted as 
  STATE. SECDEF shouldn't be treated as reference to SECSTATE. Fixed.
* Improved parsing of (malformed) TAGs
* Improved detection of composite TAGs like "HUMAN RIGHTS", "BUSH GEORGE"
* Improved parsing of subjects
* Cleaned-up valid station identifier constants (removed illegal station
  identifiers and added them to the constant INVALID_CABLE_IDS)
* Cable reference UNVIE an EMBASSY VIENNA were treated the same way (both
  were considered to represent the US Mission Vienna). Fixed.
* Updated reference parsing. Added option to return canonical identifiers
  (enabled by default)
* Improved reference parsing: More legal (even malformed) references are 
  detected
* Better handling of malformed/illegal cable identifiers
* Added canonical_id property to models.Cable which returns the canonical 
  identifier of the cable (which may be different from the cable's 
  reference_id property and which may not be a valid referenceable 
  WikiLeaks identifier anymore)
* Added support to parse media IRIs to the reader module
* Added media_uris property to models.Cable which gives information about
  the media coverage
* Cables which have a header but no content were interpreted wrong: The header
  was set to the ``models.Cable.content`` property and the ``models.Cable.header``
  property was an empty string. Fixed.
* Added/updated test cases (now: 1.000+ test cases)
* Removed deprecated functions/modules


2011-06-23 -- 0.2.0
-------------------
* Added more acronyms
* Better extraction of subjects
* Removed (debug) logging msgs of missing subjects/transmission ids
* Deprecated ``cablemap.core.handler.py``, use ``cablemap.tm.handler.py``
* Improved TAGS parsing
* Improved summary parsing
* Improved performance: Many cable properties are initialized lazily.


2011-02-15 -- 0.1.0
-------------------
* Initial release
