Installation
============

Cablemap was tested with Python 2.5 and upwards (it was not tested against
Python 3.x) and has no further dependencies. Simply install ``cablemap.core`` 
via::

    pip install cablemap.core

or::

    easy_install cablemap.core

and you're done.

To convert the cables into Topic Maps, install the ``cablemap.tm`` package via::

    pip install cablemap.tm

or::

    easy_install cablemap.tm

The ``cablemap.tm`` package has dependencies to other packages like 
`tm <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tm>`_ which are installed automatically.
