Introduction
============
Cablemap can be used to parse the `WikiLeaks Cablegate <http://wikileaks.org/cablegate.html>`_
dataset. 

Cablemap works with the dataset provided by WikiLeaks (the .torrent files) and 
with the unofficial "cables.csv" distribution (see `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_diplomatic_cables_leak#September_2011_release_of_unredacted_cables>`_).

Since the official dataset contains some oddities (see 
`Unredacted Wikileaks archive leaked <http://aebr.home.xs4all.nl/wl/theleak.html>`_) 
it is recommended to use the "cables.csv" file to parse the cables. Parsing the
CSV file outperforms reading the directory structure, too. Note that the CSV file 
does not contain any information about the media coverage of the cables. If this
information is required, the official WikiLeaks dataset is required.
